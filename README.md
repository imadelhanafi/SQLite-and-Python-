# SQLite and Pandas

This is a simple project to do data analysis on large datasets using SQLite, Pandas and Ipython Notebooks.

### Steps

  - Create an SQLite embedded database
  - Load the CSV chunk-by-chunk into a DataFrame
  - Append data to the SQLite database
  - Run SQL commands and get the result into a Pandas DataFrame.

### Advantages

Using the method described above, we can load large datasets into a single database file and work in a friendly development environment (Python and Pandas) without any additional setup.
